This is the repo for Cloud predict +, a tool that uses Planet Labs imagery to update and improve NOAA weather predictions on a local scale.

To get started, check out `using_cloud_predict.ipynb`

Note that due to Planet dependencies, the code will probably need to be run inside of a docker container. 

The example code can also be found in the `main()` function of `cloudpredict.py`, which should be easier to run inside of docker.
